Alternatively, you can choose not to adjust your ability scores, in which case this card has no effect.\n • Comet. The next time you enter combat against one or more Hostile creatures, you can select one of them as your foe when you roll Initiative. If you reduce your foe to 0 Hit Points during that combat, you have Advantage on Death Saving Throws for 1 year. If someone else reduces your chosen foe to 0 Hit Points or you don’t choose a foe, this card has no effect.\n • Donjon. You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you’re wearing and carrying disappears with you except for Artifacts, which stay behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can’t be located by any Divination magic, but a Wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.\n • Euryale. The card’s medusa-like visage curses you. You take a −2 penalty to saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of the Fates card can end this curse.\n • Fates. Reality’s fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card’s magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.\n • Flames. A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and torments you, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.\n • Fool. You have Disadvantage on D20 Tests for the next 72 hours. Draw another card; this draw doesn’t count as one of your declared draws.\n • Gem. Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 GP each or fifty gems worth 1,000 GP each appear at your feet.\n • Jester. You have Advantage on D20 Tests for the next 72 hours, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.\n • Key. A Rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears on your person. The DM chooses the weapon.\n • Knight. You gain the service of a Knight, who magically appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet of yourself. The knight has the same alignment as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the two of you have been drawn together by fate. Work with your DM to create a name and backstory for this NPC. The DM can use a different stat block to represent the knight, as desired.\n • Moon. You gain the ability to cast Wish 1d3 times.\n • Puzzle. Permanently reduce your Intelligence or Wisdom by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.\n • Rogue. An NPC of the DM’s choice becomes Hostile toward you. You don’t know the identity of this NPC until they or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a Wish spell or divine intervention can end the NPC’s hostility toward you.\n • Ruin. All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. If you have a Bastion (see chapter 8), it is destroyed by some calamity beyond your control. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.\n • Sage. At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question.\n • Skull. An Avatar of Death (see the accompanying stat block) appears in an unoccupied space as close to you as possible. The avatar targets only you with its attacks, appearing as a ghostly skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. The avatar disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or you die. If an ally of yours deals damage to the avatar, that ally summons another Avatar of Death. The new avatar appears in an unoccupied space as close to that ally as possible and targets only that ally with its attacks. You and your allies can each summon only one avatar as a consequence of this draw. A creature slain by an avatar can’t be restored to life.\n • Star. Increase one of your ability scores by 2, to a maximum of 24.\n • Sun. A magic item (chosen by the DM) appears on your person. In addition, you gain 10 Temporary Hit Points daily at dawn until you die.\n • Talons. Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession vanish instead.\n • Throne. You gain proficiency and Expertise in your choice of History, Insight, Intimidation, or Persuasion. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently home to one or more monsters, which must be cleared out before you can claim the keep as yours.\n • The Void. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM’s choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is inert, ceases aging, and requires no food, air, or water. A Wish spell can’t return your soul to your body, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds your soul. You draw no more cards.",

Doing so destroys the pellet and ends its magic.\n   As a Utilize action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the dust on an Elemental within 5 feet of yourself that is composed mostly of water (such as a Water Elemental or a Water Weird). Such a creature exposed to a pinch of the dust makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.",

    "descriptionFull": "This fine wooden box contains 1d4 pots of pigment and a brush (weighing 1 pound in total).\n Using the brush and expending 1 pot of pigment, you can paint any number of three-dimensional objects and terrain features (such as walls, doors, trees, flowers, weapons, webs, and pits), provided these elements are all confined to a 20-foot Cube. The effort takes 10 minutes (regardless of the number of elements you create), during which time you must remain in the Cube, and requires Concentration. If your Concentration is broken or you leave the Cube before the work is done, all the painted elements vanish, and the pot of pigment is wasted.\n When the work is done, all the painted objects and terrain features become real. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door, which can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit creates a real pit, the entire depth of which must lie within the 20-foot Cube.\n No object created by a pot of pigment can have a value greater than 25 GP, and the total value of all objects created by a pot of pigment can’t exceed 500 GP. If you paint objects of greater value (such as a large pile of gold), they look authentic, but close inspection reveals they’re made from paste, cookies, or some other worthless material.\n If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm.",

The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane of existence, so it can’t be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open Portable Hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it.\n You can take a Magic action to close a Portable Hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what’s in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.\n If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole’s extradimensional space can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the Portable Hole. A closed Portable Hole holds enough air for 1 hour of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.\n Placing a Portable Hole inside an extradimensional space created by a Bag of Holding, Heward’s Handy Haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes.

The rod’s flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic Battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.\n  Button 3. The rod’s flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod’s tip, and the rod’s handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic Spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.\n  Button 4. The rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long (you specify the length), though the rod’s buttons remain within your reach. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.\n  Button 5. The rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength (Athletics) checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.\n  Button 6. The rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.)

If the item wins the contest, it makes one or more of the following demands:\n    • It insists on being carried or worn at all times.\n    • It demands that its wielder dispose of anything it finds repugnant.\n    • It demands that its wielder pursue its goals to the exclusion of all other goals.\n    • It demands to be given to someone else.\n   If its wielder refuses to comply with its wishes, it can do any or all of the following:\n    • Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it.\n    • Suppress one or more of its activated properties.\n    • Attempt to take control of its wielder.\n   Once per dawn, a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, which must make a Charisma save, with a DC equal to 12 + the item's Charisma modifier. If failed, the wielder is charmed by the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item's commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the save, ending the effect on a success."

The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw.

In its original form, it had a platinum hilt and guard, and a thin crystal blade as strong as steel.\n   Strahd employed a powerful wizard named Khazan to destroy the weapon after Sergei's death. The first part of the process required the hilt and the blade to be separated, which Khazan accomplished. While Khazan was busying himself destroying the blade, his apprentice stole the hilt and fled. Khazan later located his apprentice's mutilated corpse in the Svalich Woods, but the hilt was nowhere to be found. To avoid the vampire's wrath, Khazan told Strahd that the entire weapon had been destroyed.\n   The hilt, which is sentient, knows that it can never be reunited with its original crystal blade. It has, however, gained the properties of a sun blade. While grasping the hilt, I can use a bonus action to make a blade of pure radiance spring from the hilt, or cause the blade to disappear.

If its wielder acts in a manner opposed to the item's alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder's Charisma check. If the item wins the contest, it makes one or more of the following demands:\n    • It insists on being carried or worn at all times.\n    • It demands that its wielder dispose of anything it finds repugnant.\n    • It demands that its wielder pursue its goals to the exclusion of all other goals.\n    • It demands to be given to someone else.\n   If its wielder refuses to comply with its wishes, it can do any or all of the following:\n    • Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it.\n    • Suppress one or more of its activated properties.\n    • Attempt to take control of its wielder.\n   Once per dawn, a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, which must make a Charisma save, with a DC equal to 12 + the item's Charisma modifier. If failed, the wielder is charmed by the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item's commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the save, ending the effect on a success."

It is sentient and has more features, see Notes page.",
    "descriptionFull": "The Blackstaff is a sentient, rune-carved staff set with thin silver veins. It is the symbol of office for the Blackstaff, the highest-ranking wizard in Waterdeep. As the rightful owner of the Blackstaff, Vajra Safahr is the only one who can become attuned to it. The staff can, however, choose a new owner (see \"Personality\" below).\n   This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls.\n   The staff has 20 charges for the following properties. The staff regains 2d8+4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage roll but loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regain 1d8+2 charges.\n   Power Strike. When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d6 force damage to the target.\n   Spells. While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: Cone of Cold (5 charges), Fireball (5th-level version, 5 charges), Globe of Invulnerability (6 charges), Hold Monster (5 charges), Levitate (2 charges). Lightning Bolt (5th-level version, 5 charges), Magic Missile (1 charge), Ray of Enfeeblement (1 charge), or Wall of Force (5 charges).\n   Retributive Strike. You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.\n   You have a 50% chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.\n\nDistance from Origin\tEffect\n10 ft. away or closer\t8 × the number of charges in the staff\n11 to 20 ft. away\t6 × the number of charges in the staff\n21 to 30 ft. away\t4 × the number of charges in the staff\n\n\n   Animate Walking Statues. You can expend 1 or more of the staff's charges as an action to animate or deactivate one or more of the walking statues of Waterdeep. You must be in the city to use this property, and you can animate or deactivate one statue for each charge expended. An animated statue obeys the telepathic commands of Khelben Arunsun's spirit, which is trapped inside the staff (see \"Personality\" below). A walking statue becomes inanimate if deactivated or if the staff is broken.\n   Dispel Magic. You can expend 1 of the staff's charges as a bonus action to cast Dispel Magic on a creature, an object, or a magical effect that you touch with the tip of the staff. If the target is an unwilling creature or an object in the possession of such a creature, you must hit the creature with a melee attack using the Blackstaff before you can expend the charge to cast the spell.\n   Drain Magic. This property affects only creatures that use spell slots. When you hit such a creature with a melee attack using the Blackstaff, you can expend 1 of the staff's charges as a bonus action, causing the target to expend one spell slot of the highest spell level it can cast without casting a spell. If the target has already expended all its spell slots, nothing happens.

The piece containing Khelben's spirit has the staff's Sentience property but none of its other properties. As long as this piece of the staff exists, Khelben's spirit can make the staff whole again whenever he wishes.

        "note": "\n   The Blackstaff is a sentient, rune-carved staff set with thin silver veins. It is the symbol of office for the Blackstaff, the highest-ranking wizard in Waterdeep. As the rightful owner of the Blackstaff, Vajra Safahr is the only one who can become attuned to it. The staff can, however, choose a new owner (see \"Personality\" below).\n   This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, I gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls.\n   The staff has 20 charges for the following properties. The staff regains 2d8+4 expended charges daily at dawn. If I expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage roll but loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regain 1d8+2 charges.\n   POWER STRIKE. When I hit with a melee attack using the staff, I can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d6 force damage to the target.\n   SPELLS. While holding this staff, I can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using my spell save DC and spell attack bonus: Cone of Cold (5 charges), Fireball (5th-level version, 5 charges), Globe of Invulnerability (6 charges), Hold Monster (5 charges), Levitate (2 charges). Lightning Bolt (5th-level version, 5 charges), Magic Missile (1 charge), Ray of Enfeeblement (1 charge), or Wall of Force (5 charges).\n   RETRIBUTIVE STRIKE. I can use an action to break the staff over my knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.\n   I have a 50% chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If I fail to avoid the effect, I take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.\n\nDISTANCE FROM ORIGIN\tEFFECT\n10 ft. away or closer\t8 × the number of charges in the staff\n11 to 20 ft. away\t6 × the number of charges in the staff\n21 to 30 ft. away\t4 × the number of charges in the staff\n\n\n   ANIMATE WALKING STATUES. I can expend 1 or more of the staff's charges as an action to animate or deactivate one or more of the walking statues of Waterdeep. I must be in the city to use this property, and I can animate or deactivate one statue for each charge expended. An animated statue obeys the telepathic commands of Khelben Arunsun's spirit, which is trapped inside the staff (see \"Personality\" below). A walking statue becomes inanimate if deactivated or if the staff is broken.\n   DISPEL MAGIC. I can expend 1 of the staff's charges as a bonus action to cast Dispel Magic on a creature, an object, or a magical effect that I touch with the tip of the staff. If the target is an unwilling creature or an object in the possession of such a creature, I must hit the creature with a melee attack using the Blackstaff before I can expend the charge to cast the spell.\n   DRAIN MAGIC. This property affects only creatures that use spell slots. When I hit such a creature with a melee attack using the Blackstaff, I can expend 1 of the staff's charges as a bonus action, causing the target to expend one spell slot of the highest spell level it can cast without casting a spell. If the target has already expended all its spell slots, nothing happens. Spell slots that are expended in this fashion are regained when the target finishes a long rest, as normal.\n   MASTER OF ENCHANTMENT. When I cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher while holding the staff, I can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC of 10 + the level of the spell. If the check succeeds, I cast the spell without expending a spell slot.\n   SENTIENCE. The Blackstaff is a sentient staff of neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature that is holding it.\n   PERSONALITY. The staff has the spirits of all previous Blackstaffs trapped within it. Its creator, Khelben Arunsun, is the dominant personality among them. Like Khelben, the staff is extremely devious and manipulative. It prefers to counsel its owner without exerting outright control. The staff's primary goal is to protect Waterdeep and its Open Lord, currently Laeral Silverhand. Its secondary goal is to help its wielder become more powerful.\n   In the event that the holder of the office of the Blackstaff no longer serves the staff's wishes, the staff ceases to function until it finds a worthy inheritor—someone whose loyalty to Waterdeep is beyond reproach.\n   SPIRIT TRAP. When the Blackstaff dies, the spirit of that individual becomes trapped in the staff along with the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs. (A Blackstaff whose spirit is trapped in the staff can't be raised from the dead.)\n   Destroying the staff would release the spirits trapped inside it, but in that event, Khelben's spirit can lodge itself inside any one piece of the staff that remains. The piece containing Khelben's spirit has the staff's Sentience property but none of its other properties. As long as this piece of the staff exists, Khelben's spirit can make the staff whole again whenever he wishes. When the staff is remade, the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs become trapped inside it again."

If failed, the wielder is charmed by the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item's commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the save, ending the effect on a success."

If failed, the wielder is charmed by the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item's commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the save, ending the effect on a success."

You telepathically ask the soul a question and receive a brief telepathic response, which you can understand. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic.\n\n   Freeing a Soul. Casting a spell that removes a curse on a soul coin frees the soul trapped within it, as does expending all of the coin's charges. The coin itself rusts from within and is destroyed once the soul is released. A freed soul travels to the realm of the god it served or the outer plane most closely tied to its alignment (DM's choice). The souls of lawful evil creatures released from soul coins typically emerge from the River Styx as lemure devils.\n   A soul can also be freed by destroying the coin that contains it. A soul coin has AC 19, 1 hit point for each charge it has remaining, and immunity to all damage except that which is dealt by a hellfire weapon or an infernal war machine's furnace.\n   Freeing a soul from a soul coin is considered a good act, even if the soul belongs to an evil creature.\n   Hellish Currency. Soul coins are a currency of the Nine Hells and are highly valued by devils. The coins are used among the infernal hierarchy to barter for favors, bribe the unwilling, and reward the faithful for services rendered.\n   Soul coins are created by Mammon and his greater devils on Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells, in a vast chamber where the captured souls of evil mortals are bound into the coins. These coins are then distributed throughout the Nine Hells to be used for goods and services, infernal deals, dark bargains, and bribes.",

        "note": "Soul coins are about 5 inches across and about 1 inch thick, minted from infernal iron. Each coin weighs one-third of a pound, and is inscribed with Infernal writing and a spell that magically binds a single soul to the coin. Because each soul coin has a unique soul trapped within it, each has a story. A creature might have been imprisoned as a result of defaulting on a deal, while another might be the victim of a night hag's curse.\n   CARRYING SOUL COINS. To hold a soul coin is to feel the soul bound within it—overcome with rage or fraught with despair.\n   An evil creature can carry as many soul coins as it wishes (up to its maximum weight allowance). A non-evil creature can carry a number of soul coins equal to or less than its Constitution modifier without penalty. A non-evil creature carrying a number of soul coins greater than its Constitution modifier has disadvantage on its attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.\n   USING A SOUL COIN. A soul coin has 3 charges. A creature carrying the coin can use its action to expend 1 charge from a soul coin and use it to do one of the following:\n   • DRAIN LIFE. I siphon away some of the soul's essence and gain 1d10 temporary hit points.\n   • QUERY. I telepathically ask the soul a question and receive a brief telepathic response, which I can understand. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer me truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic.\n\n   FREEING A SOUL.

The crown has 10 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (spell save DC 16): charm person (1 charge), disintegrate (6 charges), fear (3 charges), finger of death (7 charges), flesh to stone (6 charges), hold person (2 charges), ray of enfeeblement (2 charges), sleep (1 charge), slow (3 charges), telekinesis (5 charges).\n   The crown regains 1d6 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn.\n   Symbiotic Nature.

After the cannon has fired, it must recharge for 5 minutes before it can be fired again. The creature firing the cannon chooses the effect from the following options:\n   Acid Jet. The cannon discharges acid in a line 300 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d10 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a creature that fails its saving throw takes 2d10 acid damage at the start of each of its turns; a creature can end this damage by using its action to wash off the acid with a pint or more of water.\n   Fire Jet. The cannon discharges fire in a line 300 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.\n   Frost Shot. The cannon shoots a ball of frost to a point you can see within 1200 feet of the cannon. The ball then expands to form a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d10 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and its speed isn't reduced. A creature whose speed is reduced by this effect can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n   Lightning Shot. The cannon shoots a ball of lightning to a point you can see within 1200 feet of the cannon. The lightning then expands to form a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures wearing metal armor have disadvantage on the save.\n   Poison Spray. The cannon expels poison gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 4d10 poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned.

It has the following four areas of expertise:\n • The history of Netheril (see the \"Fate of Netheril\" sidebar)\n • Vampirism and the traits of vampires\n • Rituals surrounding the making, bottling, and drinking of Elverquisst (a rare, ruby-colored elven liquor distilled from sunshine and rare summer fruits)\n • The tarrasque (see the Monster Manual)When making an Intelligence check to recall lore from any of its areas of expertise, the orb has a +9 bonus to its roll (including its Intelligence modifier).\n   Professor Skant takes the form of a smooth, solid, 5-pound sphere of smoky gray quartz about the size of a grapefruit. Close examination reveals two or more pinpricks of silver light deep inside the sphere.\n   Professor Skant can see and hear normally out to a range of 60 feet. Unlike most sentient items, the orb has no will of its own and can't initiate a conflict with the creature in possession of it.\n   In addition to the knowledge it possesses, Professor Skant can cast the mage hand cantrip at will. It uses the spell only to transport itself. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence."

    "descriptionFull": "A mythallar looks like an enormous crystal ball held in an ornate cradle. The globe sheds bright light in a 300-foot radius and dim light for an additional 300 feet. The globe draws magic from the Weave that can be harnessed for various purposes. For example, Netherese mages used mythallars to keep their cities aloft and empower their magic items. The bigger the mythallar, the more magic it can hold. The largest mythallars are 150 feet in diameter.\n   The Ythryn mythallar is a relatively small device—a mere 50 feet in diameter. To attune to this mythallar, a creature must finish a short rest within 30 feet of it, meditating on the mythallar. Up to eight creatures can be attuned to it at one time; otherwise, the Ythryn mythallar follows the attunement rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide. If a ninth creature tries to attune to the mythallar, nothing happens.\n   All creatures attuned to the Ythryn mythallar can sense when the device is being used. A creature attuned to the device can use any of its properties, but only if all other creatures attuned to the device agree to allow it. The Ythryn mythallar's properties are as follows:\n    • While you're on the same plane of existence as the Ythryn mythallar, you can use an action to cause it to fly in any direction you choose at a speed of 30 feet. All matter within 500 feet of the device moves with it. The Ythryn mythallar and all structures held aloft by it hover in place when not in motion.\n   • As an action, you can cause one magic item you are holding within 30 feet of the Ythryn mythallar to immediately regain all its expended charges or uses. A magic item recharged in this manner can't be recharged by the Ythryn mythallar again until after the item regains expended charges or uses on its own.\n   • You can use the Ythryn mythallar to cast the control weather spell without requiring any components and without the need for you to be outdoors. This casting of the spell has a 50-mile radius. For the duration of the spell's casting time, you must be within 30 feet of the Ythryn mythallar or the spell fails.\nTouching the Mythallar. Any creature that touches the globe of the mythallar must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 180 (20d10 + 70) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Undead have disadvantage on this saving throw. Any object that touches the globe, other than an artifact or the mythallar's cradle, is disintegrated instantly (no save).",

The mightier the dragon, the more powerful the item becomes when it is steeped in the dragon's hoard. These items, called hoard items, have four states. A hoard item in its Slumbering state has certain base properties, and it gains additional properties when it enters the Stirring (young dragon), Wakened (adult dragon), or Ascendant (ancient dragon) state.\n   Ordinarily, a hoard item must steep in a dragon's hoard for 1 year to reach the maximum possible state allowed by the age of the hoard's dragon. For example, a hoard item that steeps in an adult dragon's hoard for 1 year enters its Wakened state.\n   When a dragon is slain, the magic surrounding its hoard becomes volatile. This allows a hoard item to steep more quickly in the hoard. A hoard item steeped in a dragon's hoard for 8 hours rises one state, as long as the steeping begins within 1 hour of the dragon's death and occurs within the dragon's lair. Steeping in this way can't raise the state of the item beyond the state associated with the dragon's age.\n   Just as hoard items can grow in power by absorbing the ambient magic of a dragon's hoard, so too can these treasures fall back into slumber. If no creature is attuned to a hoard item and that item isn't in a dragon's hoard, the item decreases in power by one state every 30 days until it is Slumbering."

The mightier the dragon, the more powerful the item becomes when it is steeped in the dragon's hoard. These items, called hoard items, have four states. A hoard item in its Slumbering state has certain base properties, and it gains additional properties when it enters the Stirring (young dragon), Wakened (adult dragon), or Ascendant (ancient dragon) state.\n   Ordinarily, a hoard item must steep in a dragon's hoard for 1 year to reach the maximum possible state allowed by the age of the hoard's dragon. For example, a hoard item that steeps in an adult dragon's hoard for 1 year enters its Wakened state.\n   When a dragon is slain, the magic surrounding its hoard becomes volatile. This allows a hoard item to steep more quickly in the hoard. A hoard item steeped in a dragon's hoard for 8 hours rises one state, as long as the steeping begins within 1 hour of the dragon's death and occurs within the dragon's lair. Steeping in this way can't raise the state of the item beyond the state associated with the dragon's age.\n   Just as hoard items can grow in power by absorbing the ambient magic of a dragon's hoard, so too can these treasures fall back into slumber. If no creature is attuned to a hoard item and that item isn't in a dragon's hoard, the item decreases in power by one state every 30 days until it is Slumbering."

The mightier the dragon, the more powerful the item becomes when it is steeped in the dragon's hoard. These items, called hoard items, have four states. A hoard item in its Slumbering state has certain base properties, and it gains additional properties when it enters the Stirring (young dragon), Wakened (adult dragon), or Ascendant (ancient dragon) state.\n   Ordinarily, a hoard item must steep in a dragon's hoard for 1 year to reach the maximum possible state allowed by the age of the hoard's dragon. For example, a hoard item that steeps in an adult dragon's hoard for 1 year enters its Wakened state.\n   When a dragon is slain, the magic surrounding its hoard becomes volatile. This allows a hoard item to steep more quickly in the hoard. A hoard item steeped in a dragon's hoard for 8 hours rises one state, as long as the steeping begins within 1 hour of the dragon's death and occurs within the dragon's lair. Steeping in this way can't raise the state of the item beyond the state associated with the dragon's age.\n   Just as hoard items can grow in power by absorbing the ambient magic of a dragon's hoard, so too can these treasures fall back into slumber. If no creature is attuned to a hoard item and that item isn't in a dragon's hoard, the item decreases in power by one state every 30 days until it is Slumbering."

The mightier the dragon, the more powerful the item becomes when it is steeped in the dragon's hoard. These items, called hoard items, have four states. A hoard item in its Slumbering state has certain base properties, and it gains additional properties when it enters the Stirring (young dragon), Wakened (adult dragon), or Ascendant (ancient dragon) state.\n   Ordinarily, a hoard item must steep in a dragon's hoard for 1 year to reach the maximum possible state allowed by the age of the hoard's dragon. For example, a hoard item that steeps in an adult dragon's hoard for 1 year enters its Wakened state.\n   When a dragon is slain, the magic surrounding its hoard becomes volatile. This allows a hoard item to steep more quickly in the hoard. A hoard item steeped in a dragon's hoard for 8 hours rises one state, as long as the steeping begins within 1 hour of the dragon's death and occurs within the dragon's lair. Steeping in this way can't raise the state of the item beyond the state associated with the dragon's age.\n   Just as hoard items can grow in power by absorbing the ambient magic of a dragon's hoard, so too can these treasures fall back into slumber. If no creature is attuned to a hoard item and that item isn't in a dragon's hoard, the item decreases in power by one state every 30 days until it is Slumbering."

Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.\n\n◆ Hoard Magic Items (FToD 25)\n   Certain magic items can absorb the ambient magic of a dragon's hoard. The mightier the dragon, the more powerful the item becomes when it is steeped in the dragon's hoard. These items, called hoard items, have four states. A hoard item in its Slumbering state has certain base properties, and it gains additional properties when it enters the Stirring (young dragon), Wakened (adult dragon), or Ascendant (ancient dragon) state.\n   Ordinarily, a hoard item must steep in a dragon's hoard for 1 year to reach the maximum possible state allowed by the age of the hoard's dragon. For example, a hoard item that steeps in an adult dragon's hoard for 1 year enters its Wakened state.\n   When a dragon is slain, the magic surrounding its hoard becomes volatile. This allows a hoard item to steep more quickly in the hoard. A hoard item steeped in a dragon's hoard for 8 hours rises one state, as long as the steeping begins within 1 hour of the dragon's death and occurs within the dragon's lair. Steeping in this way can't raise the state of the item beyond the state associated with the dragon's age.\n   Just as hoard items can grow in power by absorbing the ambient magic of a dragon's hoard, so too can these treasures fall back into slumber. If no creature is attuned to a hoard item and that item isn't in a dragon's hoard, the item decreases in power by one state every 30 days until it is Slumbering."

The mightier the dragon, the more powerful the item becomes when it is steeped in the dragon's hoard. These items, called hoard items, have four states. A hoard item in its Slumbering state has certain base properties, and it gains additional properties when it enters the Stirring (young dragon), Wakened (adult dragon), or Ascendant (ancient dragon) state.\n   Ordinarily, a hoard item must steep in a dragon's hoard for 1 year to reach the maximum possible state allowed by the age of the hoard's dragon. For example, a hoard item that steeps in an adult dragon's hoard for 1 year enters its Wakened state.\n   When a dragon is slain, the magic surrounding its hoard becomes volatile. This allows a hoard item to steep more quickly in the hoard. A hoard item steeped in a dragon's hoard for 8 hours rises one state, as long as the steeping begins within 1 hour of the dragon's death and occurs within the dragon's lair. Steeping in this way can't raise the state of the item beyond the state associated with the dragon's age.\n   Just as hoard items can grow in power by absorbing the ambient magic of a dragon's hoard, so too can these treasures fall back into slumber. If no creature is attuned to a hoard item and that item isn't in a dragon's hoard, the item decreases in power by one state every 30 days until it is Slumbering."

If reduced to 0 hit points, the orb shatters.\n\n◆ Sentient Item Conflict (SRD 252, DMG 216)A sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its personality and alignment. If its wielder acts in a manner opposed to the item's alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder's Charisma check. If the item wins the contest, it makes one or more of the following demands:\n    • It insists on being carried or worn at all times.\n    • It demands that its wielder dispose of anything it finds repugnant.\n    • It demands that its wielder pursue its goals to the exclusion of all other goals.\n    • It demands to be given to someone else.\n   If its wielder refuses to comply with its wishes, it can do any or all of the following:\n    • Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it.\n    • Suppress one or more of its activated properties.\n    • Attempt to take control of its wielder.\n   Once per dawn, a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, which must make a Charisma save, with a DC equal to 12 + the item's Charisma modifier. If failed, the wielder is charmed by the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item's commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the save, ending the effect on a success."

While holding the jewel, I can expend 1 charge from it to cast the invisibility spell.\n\nAWAKENED\n   In this state, the jewel has received the blessing of Avandra the Change Bringer. Three delicate spires unfurl from the jewel's center, like the buds of flowers opening in the spring. Three lapis lazuli stones rest like dewdrops on these spires.\n   The following benefits of the jewel improve:\n   • The bonus that the jewel confers to my AC increases to +2.\n   • Its number of charges increases to 5.\n   The jewel gains the following additional properties, which I can use while wearing or holding it:\n   • I can expend 1 of the jewel's charges (no action required) to end one of the following conditions on myself: grappled, paralyzed, or restrained.\n   • When another creature I can see within 60 ft of me fails a saving throw, I can expend 1 of the jewel's charges as a reaction to enable that creature to reroll the saving throw, potentially turning a failure into a success. The creature must use the new roll.\n\nEXALTED\n   In this state, the jewel has received the blessing of Corellon the Arch Heart. A gleaming emerald surrounded by a halo of gold appears on the jewel.\n   The following benefits of the jewel improve:\n   • The bonus that the jewel confers to my AC increases to +3.\n   • Its number of charges increases to 7.\n   The jewel gains the following additional properties, which I can use while wearing or holding it:\n   • I gain the ability to breathe water, and I gain a swimming speed equal to my walking speed.\n   • Each of my allies within 30 ft of me gains the ability to breathe water and gains a swimming speed equal to its walking speed.\n   • As a bonus action, I can expend 1 of the jewel's charges to target myself or one willing creature I can see within 15 ft of myself. The target teleports to an unoccupied space of my choice within 15 ft of myself, along with any equipment the target is wearing or carrying. The target appears in a flash of golden radiance, and each creature of my choice within 5 ft of the target's new location must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 4d10 radiant damage and is blinded until the start of my next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't blinded."

It is immune to the knock spell and similar magic, such as that of a chime of opening.\n   Although it looks like stone, the tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents creatures from tipping it over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. While merged with natural stone, the mudslick tower has immunity to all damage. Only a wish spell can repair the tower (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower).

It is immune to the knock spell and similar magic, such as that of a chime of opening.\n   Although it looks like stone, the tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents creatures from tipping it over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. While merged with natural stone, the mudslick tower has immunity to all damage. Only a wish spell can repair the tower (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of wish causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points."

    "descriptionFull": "Over the centuries since the first Deck of Many Things was created, many have sought and failed to replicate it. But some have created new cards. These forty-four additional cards are known collectively as the Deck of Many More Things. (More information on creating new cards for this deck appears in chapter 2.)\n   Like the Deck of Many Things, the Deck of Many More Things manifests differently on various worlds. While it can include fewer or different cards, it frequently appears with a Deck of Many Things as part of a combined deck of sixty-six illuminated cards. The combined deck is usually protected by a box or pouch. The forty-four cards of the Deck of Many More Things bear similar imagery to those in the Deck of Many Things and have potent magical effects, which are detailed later in this description. Notably, cards from the Deck of Many More Things are more likely to be beneficial, though about a third of them are still dangerous.\n   Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly. Unless a card allows you to draw additional cards, any cards drawn exceeding this number have no effect.\n   As soon as you draw a card, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card you declared no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. Unless a card states otherwise, if you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck and take effect simultaneously.\n   Unless it is the Fool or the Jester card, a drawn card immediately takes effect, fades from existence, and reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card multiple times.\n   The DM can use the physical cards provided in The Deck of Many Things card set to build a combined Deck of Many Things and Deck of Many More Things, including whichever cards they desire.

The appearance of the homunculus is determined by the DM, and the homunculus treats you as its creator.\n   Corpse. You immediately drop to 0 hit points, have the unconscious condition, and must begin making death saving throws. Spells and other magical effects that restore hit points have no effect on you until you are stabilized. If you fail three death saving throws, you die and can be resurrected only by the Wish spell.\n   Crossroads. Roll a d20. If the roll is even, you age 1d10 years. If the roll is odd, you become younger by 1d10 years, to a minimum of 1 year. This effect can be undone only by the Wish spell, divine intervention, or similar magic.\n   Door. You gain the ability to cast the Gate spell 1d4 times, requiring no material components. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\n   Dragon.

Your Dexterity score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.\n   Fey. A fey crossing opens into the Feywild, and you're immediately pulled through it, disappearing in a flash of rainbow-colored light. You draw no more cards.\n   The fey crossing appears as a shimmering fractal of light above the deck, and it remains open for 1 minute after the card is drawn. The precise location in the Feywild to which the fey crossing leads is determined by the DM.\n   Fiend. A powerful Fiend appears in a nearby unoccupied space and offers you a deal.$1 The Fiend is indifferent to you and can be bargained with; it keeps its side of any bargain it makes, though it might twist the wording of any agreement to suit its purposes. If attacked, or if negotiations fail and you refuse the Fiend's offer, it returns to its home plane.\n   Giant. You immediately grow 2d10 inches in height, and your hit point maximum and current hit points both increase by 20.\n   Humanoid.

If you named an individual, you know if they are alive and any conditions they have. If you named an object, you know if it is broken or not. If you named a magic item that has charges, you know how many charges it has remaining.\n   Maze. You gain 1d3 levels of exhaustion.\n   Mine. A pile of 2d6 gems (each worth 5,000 gp) and 1d10 chunks of precious ore (each worth 2,500 gp) appears at your feet.\n   Monstrosity. A Large or larger Monstrosity with a challenge rating of 10 or less (chosen by the DM) appears in an unoccupied space within 15 feet of you. The creature is hostile toward you and attacks immediately. The creature disappears when it is killed or when you are reduced to 0 hit points. If there isn't enough space for a Large or larger creature to appear, this card has no effect.\n   Ooze. A gelatinous cube immediately appears in your space and engulfs you. The gelatinous cube is hostile and remains until it is destroyed. If there isn't enough space for the gelatinous cube to appear, this card has no effect.\n   Path. Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.\n   Pit. A pit opens beneath you. You plummet 3d6 × 10 feet, take damage from the fall, and have the prone condition.\n   Plant. You gain the ability to cast Speak with Plants without using a spell slot; you must finish a long rest before you can cast it this way again. If you have spell slots of 3rd level or higher, you can cast this spell using them. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\n   Priest. Your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.\n   Prisoner. Glowing chains made of magical force appear and wrap around you. You have the restrained condition until the chains are destroyed or you are freed. While you have this condition, you can't cast spells, and any magic items you're wearing or carrying have their properties suppressed. You draw no more cards. The chains are immune to damage and can't be dispelled using the Dispel Magic spell or similar magic. However, a Disintegrate spell destroys the chains instantly, freeing you. Another creature can also free you by succeeding on a DC 30 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.\n   Ring. A rare or rarer magic ring appears on your finger. If you have the attunement slots available, you're automatically attuned to the ring when it appears. The DM chooses the ring.\n   Shield. A rare or rarer suit of magic armor that you are proficient with appears in your hands. The DM chooses the armor. If you lack proficiency with any armor, your base AC instead now equals 12 + your Dexterity modifier while you aren't wearing armor.\n   Ship. You gain proficiency in three skills chosen by the DM.\n   Staff. A rare or rarer magic rod, staff, or wand appears in your hands. The DM chooses the item.\n   Stairway. You can choose to either decrease your number of declared draws by two or receive a rare or rarer wondrous item, which appears in your hands. The DM chooses the item.\n   Statue. You immediately have the petrified condition as your body is transformed into marble. The petrification lasts until you are freed with the Greater Restoration spell or similar magic.\n   Tavern. Your Charisma score increases by 2 to a maximum of 22.\n   Temple. A deity or entity of similar power becomes bound to aid you. At any point in time between drawing the card and when you die, you can use your action to call on this entity for divine intervention, and the entity is bound to answer. The parameters and nature of this intervention are chosen by the DM. If you die without having used this intervention, the deity fulfills its obligation by casting the Resurrection spell on you. Once the entity has answered your call for divine intervention or resurrected you, the entity is no longer bound to aid you.\n   Tomb. At any time you choose within 1 year of drawing this card, you can cast the True Resurrection spell once without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\n   Tower. Draw two additional cards beyond your declared number of draws. The magic of these cards doesn't immediately take effect; instead, choose one of the two additional cards to keep, returning the other to the deck. The magic of the card you keep takes effect immediately thereafter.\n   Tree. Your skin immediately becomes rough, like tree bark. Your base AC now equals 15 + your Dexterity modifier while you aren't wearing armor, but you have vulnerability to fire damage. This transformation can be undone only by the Wish spell, divine intervention, or similar magic.\n   Undead. Somewhere on the Material Plane, a revenant rises. This revenant blames you for its existence and relentlessly hunts you to exact its revenge. The revenant exists until either 1 year passes, the revenant kills you, or you use a Wish spell to banish it permanently to the afterlife.\n   Warrior. Your Strength score increases by 2 to a maximum of 22.\n   Well. You learn three cantrips of your choice from any spell list.",

        "note": "Like the Deck of Many Things, the Deck of Many More Things manifests differently on various worlds. While it can include fewer or different cards, it frequently appears with a Deck of Many Things as part of a combined deck of sixty-six illuminated cards. The combined deck is usually protected by a box or pouch. The forty-four cards of the Deck of Many More Things bear similar imagery to those in the Deck of Many Things and have potent magical effects, which are detailed later in this description. Notably, cards from the Deck of Many More Things are more likely to be beneficial, though about a third of them are still dangerous.\n   Before I draw a card, I must declare how many cards I intend to draw and then draw them randomly. Unless a card allows me to draw additional cards, any cards drawn exceeding this number have no effect.\n   As soon as I draw a card, its magic takes effect. I must draw each card I declared no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. Unless a card states otherwise, if I fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck and take effect simultaneously.\n   Unless it is the Fool or the Jester card, a drawn card immediately takes effect, fades from existence, and reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card multiple times.\n   The DM can use the physical cards provided in The Deck of Many Things card set to build a combined Deck of Many Things and Deck of Many More Things, including whichever cards they desire.

          "This wand is shaped like a drop spindle wrapped in red thread. The wand has 6 charges, regaining 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. The charges can be used for the following properties:>>Battle Foreknowledge<<. When I roll initiative, I can expend 1 charge to add or subtract my proficiency bonus from the total roll.\n\n   DOOM FORETOLD\n   As an action, I can expend 2 charges to target a creature within 30 ft of myself and invoke that creature's doom. While the target is on the same plane of existence as I am, I can sense the direction to its location, and I know the direction of its movement if it's in motion. Additionally, once per turn when I deal damage to the doomed creature, I can roll 1d6 and add the number rolled to the damage roll. These benefits persist for 1 hour or until I target another creature with this effect.\n\n   TWIST OF FATE\n   When a creature within 60 ft of me makes a saving throw or an attack roll, I can use my reaction to expend 3 charges and alter the outcome, turning a failed saving throw into a successful one, a missed attack roll into a hit, or vice versa."

If failed, the wielder is charmed by the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item's commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the save, ending the effect on a success."

    "descriptionFull": "A docent is a small metal sphere, approximately 2 inches across, studded with dragonshards. Despite a strong magical aura, it has no obvious abilities. When you attune to a docent, the sphere becomes embedded in your chest and comes to life—literally.\n   Sentience. A docent is a sentient neutral item with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 14. It can perceive the world through your senses.\n   A docent communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common and Giant.\n   Personality. A docent is designed to advise and assist the warforged it's attached to. One of the simple functions of a docent is to serve as a translator. The docent's properties are under its control, and if you have a bad relationship with your docent it may refuse to assist you… or simply lie about information that it obtains. However, if you treat your docent well it could serve as a useful ally.\n   The origin of docents is a great mystery. House Cannith created the first warforged thirty years ago. But the docents come from the distant land of Xen'drik and appear to be thousands of years old. Were they created to interface with some other form of construct? Or are the modern warforged a new interpretation of an ancient design? The docents claim to have forgotten their creators… but this is a mystery waiting to be unraveled. While all docents come from Xen'drik, some have been brought to Khorvaire by explorers and it's possible to encounter them in the Five Nations.\n   Languages. All docents understand Common and Giant, but a docent knows up to four additional languages. Elvish and Draconic are common options. If a docent knows less than six languages in total, it can add new languages to its repertoire after encountering them. So a docent found in Xen'drik may have never encountered a dwarf before… but after spending some time in Khorvaire studying dwarves, it could pick up the Dwarvish language.\n   Properties. A docent possesses up to three of the following properties:\n   • The docent can cast the detect magic spell at will.\n   • The docent can cast the detect evil and good spell at will.\n   • The docent can detect any form of divination or scrying targeting it and its warforged host.\n   • The docent has a +7 bonus to Intelligence (Arcana) checks.\n   • The docent has a +7 bonus to Intelligence (History) checks.\n   • The docent has a +7 bonus to Intelligence (Investigation) checks.\n   • The docent has a +7 bonus to Intelligence (Nature) checks.\n   • The docent has a +6 bonus to Wisdom (Insight) checks.\n   • The docent has a +6 bonus to Wisdom (Perception) checks.\n   • The docent has a +6 bonus to Wisdom (Medicine) checks targeting its warforged host. If the host is rendered unconscious, the docent will automatically attempt to stabilize them once each turn.\n   You can use a bonus action on your turn to request that the docent use one of its properties on your behalf.",

        "note": "A docent is a small metal sphere, approximately 2 inches across, studded with dragonshards. Despite a strong magical aura, it has no obvious abilities. When I attune to a docent, the sphere becomes embedded in my chest and comes to life—literally.\n   SENTIENCE. A docent is a sentient neutral item with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 14. It can perceive the world through my senses.\n   A docent communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common and Giant.\n   PERSONALITY. A docent is designed to advise and assist the warforged it's attached to. One of the simple functions of a docent is to serve as a translator. The docent's properties are under its control, and if I have a bad relationship with my docent it may refuse to assist me… or simply lie about information that it obtains. However, if I treat my docent well it could serve as a useful ally.\n   The origin of docents is a great mystery. House Cannith created the first warforged thirty years ago. But the docents come from the distant land of Xen'drik and appear to be thousands of years old. Were they created to interface with some other form of construct? Or are the modern warforged a new interpretation of an ancient design? The docents claim to have forgotten their creators… but this is a mystery waiting to be unraveled. While all docents come from Xen'drik, some have been brought to Khorvaire by explorers and it's possible to encounter them in the Five Nations.\n   LANGUAGES. All docents understand Common and Giant, but a docent knows up to four additional languages. Elvish and Draconic are common options. If a docent knows less than six languages in total, it can add new languages to its repertoire after encountering them. So a docent found in Xen'drik may have never encountered a dwarf before… but after spending some time in Khorvaire studying dwarves, it could pick up the Dwarvish language.\n   PROPERTIES. A docent possesses up to three of the following properties:\n   • The docent can cast the detect magic spell at will.\n   • The docent can cast the detect evil and good spell at will.\n   • The docent can detect any form of divination or scrying targeting it and its warforged host.\n   • The docent has a +7 bonus to Intelligence (Arcana) checks.\n   • The docent has a +7 bonus to Intelligence (History) checks.\n   • The docent has a +7 bonus to Intelligence (Investigation) checks.\n   • The docent has a +7 bonus to Intelligence (Nature) checks.\n   • The docent has a +6 bonus to Wisdom (Insight) checks.\n   • The docent has a +6 bonus to Wisdom (Perception) checks.\n   • The docent has a +6 bonus to Wisdom (Medicine) checks targeting its warforged host. If the host is rendered unconscious, the docent will automatically attempt to stabilize them once each turn.\n   I can use a bonus action on my turn to request that the docent use one of its properties on my behalf.\n\n◆ Sentient Item Conflict (SRD 252, DMG 216)A sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its personality and alignment. If its wielder acts in a manner opposed to the item's alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder's Charisma check. If the item wins the contest, it makes one or more of the following demands:\n    • It insists on being carried or worn at all times.\n    • It demands that its wielder dispose of anything it finds repugnant.\n    • It demands that its wielder pursue its goals to the exclusion of all other goals.\n    • It demands to be given to someone else.\n   If its wielder refuses to comply with its wishes, it can do any or all of the following:\n    • Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it.\n    • Suppress one or more of its activated properties.\n    • Attempt to take control of its wielder.\n   Once per dawn, a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, which must make a Charisma save, with a DC equal to 12 + the item's Charisma modifier. If failed, the wielder is charmed by the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item's commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the save, ending the effect on a success."

It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 30 feet. The sword communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it.\n"

        "name": "Benefits and Properties",
        "note": "While you are attuned to the sword, you gain the following benefits:\n   • Angelic Language. You can speak, read, and write Celestial.\n   • Celestial Resistance. You have resistance to necrotic and radiant damage.\n   • Divine Presence. Your Charisma score becomes 20, unless it is already 20+.\n   • Feathered Wings. You sprout a beautiful pair of feathered wings that grant\n     you a flying speed of 90 feet and the ability to hover. If you already have a\n     different kind of wings, these new wings replace the old ones, which fall off.\n   • Truesight. Your eyes become luminous pools of silver. You can see in normal\n     and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect\n     visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, perceive the\n     original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic,\n     and see into the Ethereal Plane, all within a range of 60 feet.\n   • Truth Seer. While holding the sword, you gain advantage on all Insight checks.\n\n   Properties. The Sword of Zariel has the following properties:\n   • Random Properties. The sword has 2 minor beneficial properties. (DMG 219)\n   • Holy Light. The sword sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an\n     additional 5 feet. Fiends find the sword's light disconcerting and painful, even\n     if they can't see it, and have disadvantage on attack rolls made within the\n     weapon's radius of bright light. As a bonus action, you can intensify the\n     sword's light, causing it to shed bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light\n     for an additional 15 feet, or reduce its glow to its normal intensity.\n   • Searing Radiance. The sword deals an extra 2d8 radiant damage to any\n     creature it hits, or 3d10 radiant damage if you're wielding the weapon with\n     two hands. An evil creature that takes this radiant damage must succeed on a\n     DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn.\n\n   Destroying the Sword\n   Zariel can destroy the sword simply by grasping it. She couldn't bring herself to do so when she was an angel, but as an archdevil she has no compunction about ridding the multiverse of the weapon. The sword is also destroyed if it's used to shatter the Companion (see \"Shattering the Companion\" (DiA 154)), unless the blade is wielded by an angel of challenge rating 15 or higher, or a good-aligned cleric or paladin of at least 10th level.\n   If Zariel is killed for good (that is, if she dies in the Nine Hells), the sword becomes no harder to destroy than a normal longsword.\n\n◆ Sentient Item Conflict (SRD 252, DMG 216)A sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its personality and alignment. If its wielder acts in a manner opposed to the item's alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder's Charisma check. If the item wins the contest, it makes one or more of the following demands:\n    • It insists on being carried or worn at all times.\n    • It demands that its wielder dispose of anything it finds repugnant.\n    • It demands that its wielder pursue its goals to the exclusion of all other goals.\n    • It demands to be given to someone else.\n   If its wielder refuses to comply with its wishes, it can do any or all of the following:\n    • Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it.\n    • Suppress one or more of its activated properties.\n    • Attempt to take control of its wielder.\n   Once per dawn, a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, which must make a Charisma save, with a DC equal to 12 + the item's Charisma modifier. If failed, the wielder is charmed by the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item's commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the save, ending the effect on a success."

If the staff is dragged from the pocket plane, the tome is reduced to a mundane and quite out-of-date copy of the Tome of Zyx, the work that served as the foundation for the Demonomicon.

The faces of the lantern are fitted with faceted gemstone lenses.\n   The lantern is a symbol of the teachings of Daoud, who was once a priest of Istus, a god of fate.

The lantern can hold a maximum of 10,000 gp worth of powdered gems, and it contains 9,000 gp of fuel when found. Thereafter it attempts to burn 100 gp of fuel after each year passes, keeping the lantern burning for another year. If no fuel is available, the lantern's flame goes out.

          "This artifact destroys wealth to provide light and protection. Wrought from the finest yellow gold, the lantern has four faces, and an unwavering amber flame burns within it. The faces of the lantern are fitted with faceted gemstone lenses.\n   The lantern is a symbol of the teachings of Daoud, who was once a priest of Istus, a god of fate. When Daoud was stripped of his possessions, he developed a radical new philosophy in his quest to understand fate. He urged followers of his ideology to eschew wealth and seek out all fortunes, good and ill, to unravel the cloth of destiny.\n\nRandom Properties.\n   The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the \"Artifacts\" section of the Dungeon Master's Guide:\n  2 minor beneficial properties\n  1 major beneficial property\n  1 minor detrimental property\n\nPrecious Fuel.\n   The lantern burns only one source of fuel: powdered gemstones placed in the lantern's base. The lantern can hold a maximum of 10,000 gp worth of powdered gems, and it contains 9,000 gp of fuel when found. Thereafter it attempts to burn 100 gp of fuel after each year passes, keeping the lantern burning for another year. If no fuel is available, the lantern's flame goes out. You can add more fuel to the lantern as part of a short or long rest. Once added, fuel can't be removed from the lantern's base.\n   The lantern's flame can't be extinguished by any means other than running out of fuel. If the lantern's flame goes out, the creature attuned to it immediately dies. One exception to this rule exists (see the \"Destroying the Lantern\" section).\n\nRevealing Light.\n   The lantern sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible while in the lantern's bright light.\n   While attuned to the lantern, you can use a bonus action to dim the lantern, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius, or brighten the lantern back to its normal bright light radius.\n\nLenses.\n   When found, the lantern's faces display the following gem lenses: diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire.
